# The following command will *temporarily* set the ZGB environment var
# in your current shell session (run it from the same directory as this file).
#
# Run: source install.txt
#
# Or run: export ZGB_PATH=`pwd`/common
#
# Recommended but not required:
# Add the full path to ZGB/common to your shell path defaults as ZGB_PATH.
# How to do this will depend on which command shell you use.
#
# After setting up the environment variable you can try building the example template:
#
# Run: cd examples/template/src; make

export ZGB_PATH=`pwd`/common
